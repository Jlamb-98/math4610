##Task 1
I developed a function in Python which implements Newton's Method for root finding. Click [here](newton.md) for the corresponding software manual page.

##Task 2
I developed a function in Python which implements the Secant method for Root Finding. Click [here](secant.md) for the corresponding sofware manual page.

##Task 3
Both of the previous functions accept `-v` as the final optional parameter to print each iteration root approximation in a table of results.

##Task 4
I developed a function in Python which implements a Hybrid Method of Bisection/Newton's Method. This needs to be developed more, but the basic idea is there.

##Task 5
I developed a function in Python which implements a Hybrid Method of Bisection/Secant Method. This also needs to be developed more. Both of the previous functions were added to the root finding problem file found [here](root_finding.py).
